If you're using Docusaurus, create a Markdown file (e.g., `contributors.md`) in your project's documentation folder. Make sure to customize the content with the names, contributions, and links of your actual contributors. The front matter (the section between `---`) specifies the page's title and ID, which you can use to reference the page in your documentation.

This page provides a place to acknowledge and credit contributors to your project, both core and external. Don't forget to include links to their GitHub profiles so that readers can learn more about them and their work.

To link to this page from other parts of your documentation, you can use the page's ID, like this: `[Learn more about our contributors](contributors)`.
